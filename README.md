This is my very first readme file.

Please enjoy playing my take on the CrystalsCollector game. It is essentially the same game just I used pictures of the SMU Coding Bootcamp team. This was mostly due to the fact that I couldn't find any crystal pictures that I liked.

The game is built with JavaScript. There are a handful of variables that either are assigned a random number or hold a score (gamescore, current guess, and wins/losses). I originally created this game in JavaScript and then went back to use jQuery. You will see that the JavaScript is still in the code, but has been disabled for easy comparison.

Feel free to use the console log to cheat!
